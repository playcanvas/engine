If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, please report it to us via email at **security@project-domain.com**.
Please include the following details in your report whenever possible:

- A description of the issue and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Any relevant logs, proof-of-concept code, or screenshots

**Do not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities, as this may expose other users to risk before a fix is available.
