## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, please report it to us via email at **security@project-domain.com**.

Please include the following details in your report whenever possible:

- A description of the issue and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Any relevant logs, proof-of-concept code, or screenshots
- The version(s) of the project you tested against

**Do not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities, as this may expose other users to risk before a fix is available.

We aim to acknowledge new reports within **3 business days** and to provide updates at least every **7 days** while we investigate. Once the issue is confirmed, we will work to develop and release a fix, and we will coordinate public disclosure with you whenever possible.
