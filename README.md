## Usage

Here's a super-simple Hello World example - a spinning cube!

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>PlayCanvas Hello Cube</title>
    <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no' />
    <style>
        body {
            margin: 0;
            overflow: hidden;
        }
    </style>
    <script src='https://code.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-stable.min.js'></script>
</head>
<body>
    <canvas id='application'></canvas>
    <script>
        // create a PlayCanvas application
        const canvas = document.getElementById('application');
        const app = new pc.Application(canvas);

        // fill the available space at full resolution
        app.setCanvasFillMode(pc.FILLMODE_FILL_WINDOW);
        app.setCanvasResolution(pc.RESOLUTION_AUTO);

        // ensure canvas is resized when window changes size
        window.addEventListener('resize', () => app.resizeCanvas());

        // create box entity
        const box = new pc.Entity('cube');
        box.addComponent('model', {
            type: 'box'
        });
        app.root.addChild(box);

        // create camera entity
        const camera = new pc.Entity('camera');
        camera.addComponent('camera', {
            clearColor: new pc.Color(0.1, 0.1, 0.1)
        });
        app.root.addChild(camera);
        camera.setPosition(0, 0, 3);

        // create directional light entity
        const light = new pc.Entity('light');
        light.addComponent('light');
        app.root.addChild(light);
        light.setEulerAngles(45, 0, 0);

        // rotate the box according to the delta time since the last frame
        app.on('update', dt => box.rotate(10 * dt, 20 * dt, 30 * dt));

        app.start();
    </script>
</body>

```

## How to build

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed. Then, install all of the required Node.js dependencies:

    npm install

Now you can run various build options:

| Command                | Description                               | Outputs                          |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `npm run build`        | Build release, debug and profiler engines | `build\playcanvas[.dbg/.prf].js` |
| `npm run tsd`          | Build engine Typescript bindings          | `build\playcanvas.d.ts`          |
| `npm run docs`         | Build engine [API reference docs][docs]   | `docs`                           |

Pre-built versions of the engine are also available.

Latest development release (head revision of master branch):

* https://code.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-latest.js
* https://code.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-latest.min.js

Latest stable release:

* https://code.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-stable.js
* https://code.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-stable.min.js

Specific engine versions:

* https://code.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-1.38.4.js
* https://code.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-1.38.4.min.js

### Generate Source Maps

To build the source map to allow for easier engine debugging, you can add `-- -m` to any engine build command. For example:

    npm run build -- -m

This will output to `build/output/playcanvas.js.map`

Note: The preprocessor is ignored when generating the source map as it breaks the mapping. This means that all debug and profiling code is included in the engine build when generating the source map.

## How to run tests

PlayCanvas uses of Karma for unit testing. There are two ways of running the tests:

| Command                | Description                                                                           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `npm run test`         | Runs unit tests on a built `playcanvas.js`                                            |
| `npm run test:watch`   | Re-runs unit tests when changes are detected - open http://localhost:9876/debug.html  |

## PlayCanvas Editor

The PlayCanvas Engine is an open source engine which you can use to create HTML5 apps/games. In addition to the engine, we also make the [PlayCanvas Editor](https://playcanvas.com/):

[![Editor](https://github.com/playcanvas/editor/blob/master/images/editor.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/playcanvas/editor)

For Editor related bugs and issues, please refer to the [Editor's repo](https://github.com/playcanvas/editor).
