## Usage

Here's a super-simple Hello World example - a spinning cube!

```js
import * as pc from 'playcanvas';

const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
document.body.appendChild(canvas);

const app = new pc.Application(canvas);

// fill the available space at full resolution
app.setCanvasFillMode(pc.FILLMODE_FILL_WINDOW);
app.setCanvasResolution(pc.RESOLUTION_AUTO);

// ensure canvas is resized when window changes size
window.addEventListener('resize', () => app.resizeCanvas());

// create box entity
const box = new pc.Entity('cube');
box.addComponent('model', {
  type: 'box'
});
app.root.addChild(box);

// create camera entity
const camera = new pc.Entity('camera');
camera.addComponent('camera', {
  clearColor: new pc.Color(0.1, 0.2, 0.3)
});
app.root.addChild(camera);
camera.setPosition(0, 0, 3);

// create directional light entity
const light = new pc.Entity('light');
light.addComponent('light');
app.root.addChild(light);
light.setEulerAngles(45, 0, 0);

// rotate the box according to the delta time since the last frame
app.on('update', dt => box.rotate(10 * dt, 20 * dt, 30 * dt));

app.start();
```

## PlayCanvas Editor

The PlayCanvas Engine is an open-source engine that you can use to create HTML5 apps/games. In addition to the engine, we also make the [PlayCanvas Editor](https://playcanvas.com/):
