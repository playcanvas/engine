# PlayCanvas WebGL Game Engine

PlayCanvas is an open-source game engine. It uses HTML5 and WebGL to run games and other interactive 3D content in any mobile or desktop browser.

## Project Showcase

Many games and apps have been published using the PlayCanvas engine. Here is a small selection:

## Usage

Here's a super-simple Hello World example - a spinning cube!

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>PlayCanvas Hello Cube</title>
    <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no' />
    <style>
        body {
            margin: 0;
            overflow: hidden;
        }
    </style>
    <script src='https://code.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-stable.min.js'></script>
</head>
<body>
    <canvas id='application'></canvas>
    <script>
        // create a PlayCanvas application
        var canvas = document.getElementById('application');
        var app = new pc.Application(canvas, { });
        app.start();

        // fill the available space at full resolution
        app.setCanvasFillMode(pc.FILLMODE_FILL_WINDOW);
        app.setCanvasResolution(pc.RESOLUTION_AUTO);

        // ensure canvas is resized when window changes size
        window.addEventListener('resize', function() {
            app.resizeCanvas();
        });

        // create box entity
        var cube = new pc.Entity('cube');
        cube.addComponent('model', {
            type: 'box'
        });

        // create camera entity
        var camera = new pc.Entity('camera');
        camera.addComponent('camera', {
            clearColor: new pc.Color(0.1, 0.1, 0.1)
        });

        // create directional light entity
        var light = new pc.Entity('light');
        light.addComponent('light');

        // add to hierarchy
        app.root.addChild(cube);
        app.root.addChild(camera);
        app.root.addChild(light);

        // set up initial positions and orientations
        camera.setPosition(0, 0, 3);
        light.setEulerAngles(45, 0, 0);

        // register a global update event
        app.on('update', function (deltaTime) {
            cube.rotate(10 * deltaTime, 20 * deltaTime, 30 * deltaTime);
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## How to build

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed. Then, install all of the required Node.js dependencies:

    npm install
    
To execute a build of the engine to build/playcanvas-latest.js, do:

    npm run build

Pre-built versions of the engine are also available.

Latest development release:

* https://code.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-latest.js
* https://code.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-latest.min.js

Latest stable release:

* https://code.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-stable.js

Specific engine versions:

* https://code.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-0.181.11.js
* https://code.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-0.181.11.min.js

## Releases

A full list of Releases and Release Notes is available [here](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/releases).

## How to get models?

To convert any models created using a 3D modelling package see [this page](http://developer.playcanvas.com/en/engine/) in the developer documentation.

## How to run tests

PlayCanvas makes use of Karma for running unit tests, and provides three test ways of executing them depending on what phase of development you're in:

    # Runs the tests once over the unbuilt source files - useful if you just want a quick 'all-clear'
    npm run test

    # Watches all source and test files for changes, and automatically re-runs the tests when they change.
    # Open http://localhost:9876/debug.html in your browser to debug the tests in real time.
    #
    # You can also edit the `tests/**/test_*.js` glob in tests/karma.conf.js to run a subset of the tests,
    # during development.
    npm run test:watch

    # Runs the tests once over playcanvas-latest.js - mainly used by CI, but sometimes useful if you want
    # to test the engine after building it. Make sure to do `npm run build` first to make sure you have
    # an up-to-date build.
    npm run test:release

## Documentation

Full documentation available on the [PlayCanvas Developer](http://developer.playcanvas.com) site including [API reference](http://developer.playcanvas.com/en/api/). To build a local copy of the API reference manual to the docs folder, do:

    npm run docs

## Tutorials & Examples

See all the [tutorials](http://developer.playcanvas.com/tutorials/) here.

## TypeScript Bindings

You can develop TypeScript applications against the PlayCanvas engine. To generate a TypeScript definitions file for the entire API, do:

    npm run tsd

This will output to build/output/playcanvas.d.ts
