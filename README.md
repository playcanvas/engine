## Usage

Here's a super-simple Hello World example - a spinning cube!

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>PlayCanvas Hello Cube</title>
    <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no' />
    <style>
        body {
            margin: 0;
            overflow: hidden;
        }
    </style>
    <script src='https://code.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-stable.min.js'></script>
</head>
<body>
    <canvas id='application'></canvas>
    <script>
        // create a PlayCanvas application
        const canvas = document.getElementById('application');
        const app = new pc.Application(canvas);

        // fill the available space at full resolution
        app.setCanvasFillMode(pc.FILLMODE_FILL_WINDOW);
        app.setCanvasResolution(pc.RESOLUTION_AUTO);

        // ensure canvas is resized when window changes size
        window.addEventListener('resize', () => app.resizeCanvas());

        // create box entity
        const box = new pc.Entity('cube');
        box.addComponent('model', {
            type: 'box'
        });
        app.root.addChild(box);

        // create camera entity
        const camera = new pc.Entity('camera');
        camera.addComponent('camera', {
            clearColor: new pc.Color(0.1, 0.1, 0.1)
        });
        app.root.addChild(camera);
        camera.setPosition(0, 0, 3);

        // create directional light entity
        const light = new pc.Entity('light');
        light.addComponent('light');
        app.root.addChild(light);
        light.setEulerAngles(45, 0, 0);

        // rotate the box according to the delta time since the last frame
        app.on('update', dt => box.rotate(10 * dt, 20 * dt, 30 * dt));

        app.start();
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## How to build

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed. Then, install all of the required Node.js dependencies:

    npm install

Now you can run various build options:

| Command             | Description                      | Outputs                          |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `npm run build`     | Build unminified release engine  | `build\output\playcanvas.js`     |
| `npm run build:min` | Build minified release engine    | `build\output\playcanvas.min.js` |
| `npm run build:prf` | Build unminified profiler engine | `build\output\playcanvas.prf.js` |
| `npm run build:dbg` | Build unminified debug engine    | `build\output\playcanvas.dbg.js` |
| `npm run tsd`       | Build engine Typescript bindings | `build\output\playcanvas.d.ts`   |
| `npm run doc`       | Build engine [API reference docs](https://developer.playcanvas.com/en/api/) | `docs` |

Pre-built versions of the engine are also available.

Latest development release (head revision of master branch):

* https://code.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-latest.js
* https://code.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-latest.min.js

Latest stable release:

* https://code.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-stable.js
* https://code.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-stable.min.js

Specific engine versions:

* https://code.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-0.181.11.js
* https://code.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-0.181.11.min.js

### Generate Source Maps

To build the source map to allow for easier engine debugging, you can add `-- -m` to any engine build command. For example:

    npm run build -- -m

This will output to `build/output/playcanvas.js.map`

## How to run tests

PlayCanvas uses of Karma for unit testing. There are three ways of running the tests:

| Command                | Description                                                                           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `npm run test`         | Runs unit tests over unbuilt engine source                                            |
| `npm run test:watch`   | Re-runs unit tests when changes are detected - open http://localhost:9876/debug.html  |
| `npm run test:release` | Runs unit tests on a built `playcanvas.js`                                            |

## How to get models?

To convert any models created using a 3D modelling package see [this page](https://developer.playcanvas.com/en/engine/) in the developer documentation.
