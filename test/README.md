# Unit Tests

PlayCanvas uses [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) for unit testing. All tests run in Node and load the engine's source modules directly. This means that building the engine is not a requirement for running the tests. Node is missing some features required by the engine so a couple of mocks are used:

* [`canvas-mock`](https://github.com/playcanvas/canvas-mock) - implements `HTMLCanvasElement` (and `WebGL 1.0`).
* [`xhr2`](https://github.com/pwnall/node-xhr2) - implements `XMLHttpRequest`.

## Running the Unit Tests

To run the tests, simply do:

```
npm run test
```

## Code Coverage

PlayCanvas uses [C8](https://github.com/bcoe/c8) to analyze and report unit test code coverage. To print a code coverage report, do:

```
npm run test:coverage
```

## Writing Tests

The PlayCanvas Engine is made up of ES Modules. Each module should have a corresponding unit test module. For example:

```
/src/core/math/vec3.js
```

...has the corresponding unit test module:

```
/test/math/vec3.test.mjs
```

In short, for any given engine source module:

1. Create a file in the corresponding path under `test`.
2. Replace `.js` with `.test.mjs` (the `.mjs` extension informs Node that the file is an ES Module).

Test module code should adhere to the following style:

```javascript
import { SomeClass } from '../../src/path/to/some-class.js';

import { expect } from 'chai';

describe('SomeClass', function () {

    describe('#someProperty', function () {

        it('does something', function () {
            // test code
        });

        it('does something else', function () {
            // test code
        });

    });

    describe('#constructor()', function () {

        // more tests

    });

    describe('#someFunc()', function () {

        // more tests

    });

});
```

Some tips:

* Group properties, then the constructor and then member functions in the test module.
* Alphabetize the API described in the test module (as it appears in the [API reference manual](https://developer.playcanvas.com/api/)).
* [Avoid using arrow functions](https://mochajs.org/#arrow-functions) for `describe` and `it` calls.
* Try to make the call to `it` read as a proper sentence:
  * Good: `it('returns null on failure', ...`
  * Bad: `it('null is returned', ...`

## Debugging Tests

Debugging tests is easy, convenient and fun! VS Code is the recommended IDE for debugging the tests. All you need to do is:

1. Open the root folder of your clone of the PlayCanvas Engine repo.
2. Select the Explorer panel (top icon in the left-hand vertical toolbar).
3. Navigate to the test you want to debug and set a breakpoint.
4. At the bottom of the Explorer panel, you'll find a sub-panel called NPM SCRIPTS. Locate script `test` and click the Debug button.
